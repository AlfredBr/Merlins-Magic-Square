# merlins-magic-square
This game is my first SwiftUI application.  I wrote it with my 12 year old son.
We wanted to learn iOS programming and do something fun during the COVID-19 self-quarantine.

We went from not owning (or even using) a Macintosh to a decent playable iOS/SwiftUI game in about 30 days!

You can read the rules og LightsOut here --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)
There are 7 levels in our version of Lights Out, from a 2x2 grid to a 8x8 grid.
We can't get past level 6!
