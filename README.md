This game is my first SwiftUI application.  I wrote it with my 12 year old son.
We wanted to learn iOS programming and do something fun during the COVID-19 self-quarantine.

We went from not owning (or even using) a Macintosh to a decent playable iOS/SwiftUI game in about 30 days!

There are 8 levels in our version of Lights Out, from a 2x2 grid to a 9x9 grid.
We can't get past level 6!
