# merlins-magic-square

[Merlin](http://www.theelectronicwizard.com) was an electronic toy made by Parker Bros in the 1970's.  

Merlin contained many games and one of those games was a 3x3 version of [Lights Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) called "Magic Square".

This is my version of Lights Out/Magic Square and it's my first SwiftUI application.  I wrote it with my 12 year old son.
We wanted to learn iOS programming and do something fun together during the COVID-19 self-quarantine.

We went from not owning (or even using) a Macintosh to a decent playable iOS/SwiftUI game in about 30 days!

2x2 | 4x4 | 7x7

**When all of the squares are filled with color, you win the level.**
There are 8 levels in our version of Lights Out, from a 2x2 grid to a 9x9 grid.  Some levels are very easy and others are extremely hard.

We can't get past the 7x7 grid! :smile:
