# merlins-magic-square

[Merlin](http://www.theelectronicwizard.com) was a toy made by Parker Bros in the 1970's.  It contained many games and one of those games was a 3x3 version of [LightsOut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) on it's LED "screen".

This is my version of LightsOut.  It is my first SwiftUI application.  I wrote it with my 12 year old son.
We wanted to learn iOS programming and do something fun during the COVID-19 self-quarantine.

We went from not owning (or even using) a Macintosh to a decent playable iOS/SwiftUI game in about 30 days!

Level 1 | Level 3 | Level 6

You can read the rules of [LightsOut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game))

There are 8 levels in our version of Lights Out, from a 2x2 grid to a 8x8 grid.
We can't get past level 6!
